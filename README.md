## Introduction

This repository includes the source for the Moodle Developer Resources - a
collection of resources aimed at making your life as a Moodle Developer easier.

## Contributing

These resources are written by developers, for developers. We value your input
and your help in adding to them.

There are many ways that you can help, from reporting inaccuracies, and missing
documentation, to making small corrections and, of course, creating new
resources for others to make use of.

If you plan to contribute, then you may wish to setup a local development
environment to make it easier to do so.

We highly recommend that you read our [documentation contributions guide](https://moodledev.io/general/documentation/contributing), which includes important information on [getting started](https://moodledev.io/general/documentation/contributing#getting-started).

### Installation

For more information on the installation process see our [installation documentation](https://moodledev.io/general/documentation/installation), but if you want to jump right in then the easiest way is using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then running:

```
nvm install
npm i -g yarn
yarn
yarn start
```

### Building your content

During development you will almost certainly want to use the yarn development server, however you will sometimes need to build the content to use certain
features.

This is easily achieved with yarn:

```
yarn build
```

This command will compile all of the documentation into static HTML files complete with all appropriate resources.

As part of this build, the validity of all internal links will be checked. For this reason we strongly recommend building the content locally before submitting a pull request as broken internal links will lead to a build failure
immediately.

You may also need to configure the build to view it locally. This can be achieved using a `.env` file in the project root. For more information on the format of the `.env` file, see the documentation in the `.env.default` file.
